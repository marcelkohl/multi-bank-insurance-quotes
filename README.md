# Multi bank insurance quotes
Implementation of a multi bank insurance quotes by not using any kind of framework, just the PHP language resources.

## Why?
The multi bank insurance quotes topic was used to put in practice the ability to have multiple sources of data (remote or not) and bring them in an unique collection of data, also, implementation of some resources of the PHP v7 language as classes, collections, exceptions, types, factories, abstracts, traits and interfaces, and also, TDD practices together with phpunit.

## Implementation
The implementation allows to create as many source provider are needed and set them as a collection of provider to be added in the final response.
